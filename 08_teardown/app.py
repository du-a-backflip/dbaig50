DISCO:
 - flask is a python framework used for web development
 @app.route("/") is a route to handle http requests at a url
 app.run starts a flask server (says it's running on a different server)

QCC:
0. I have seen similar syntax in java, in the constructors of objects.
1. The / is used in pathways to separate the different directories from one another. Or in this case, as a directory.
2. It prints on the terminal
3. It prints:
* Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit

4. It will be sent back to the client when accessing the / directory. You can tell because it says that it's running on a different server, and when you open the http link, it shows "no hablo queso".
5. I think I've seen similar constructs in java.
 ...

INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH:
First we made a venv and pip installed flask on it.
After installing, we read the output in the terminal that mentioned what was downloaded along with flask.
Flask uses a WSGI, an HTML renderer(Jinja2), itsdangerous, click.

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)                    # Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?

@app.route("/")                          # Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
def hello_world():
    print(__name__)                      # Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
    return "No hablo queso!"             # Q4: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?

app.run()                                # Q5: Where have you seen similar constructs in other languages?
