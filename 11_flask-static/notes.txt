NOTES:
- We are allowed to put html generated in functions in place of variables in tablified.html (don't have to outright loop through things in the template itself)
    - If you want to put an html string (a string with the tags included), into the template (using render_template), use safe filter
        - otherwise page just renders the html itself, not the page
- With app route "/wdywtbwygp", no need to add / to the end of the link when typing webpage
    - could possibly be because "/wdywtbwygp" isn't a file or directory
    - adding extra / gets you "Page Not Found"
- Can put css in html using <style> tag instead of css file
- Use <a href = Link>Word</a> for clickable links
- Make sure to use is, not 1s

Egoless programming:
- It's important to have second opinions when coding 
    - People can be blind to flaws in their code because they are attached to it
        - Instead of looking at the code's flaws, they might blame outside forces because they want
        to believe their code works (want to avoid criticism of themselves or their actions
- Programming is often considered a solitary activity but using groups can be very beneficial
    - More people familiar with program
        - More people can debug
        - Easier to gauge progress
        - Other people capable of taking over if one person can't code
        - More people that are able to properly update code if need arises
        
EGO:
- Its important to get others to read and critique your code
- Make sure everybody in a group contributes when coding and have others look over their contributions
(don't want to have mistakes that affect the whole program).
