K14 -- experimenting with intake

time spent: 0.7 hours

DISCO:
* Form action /auth could be referring to auth page (redirect to this page if submitted)
* Predictions: Shows a page with a textbox and submit button, prints "this statemen is printed in test module" in computer
    * Put values in, press submit, redirect to auth page
    * Conditional print statment for testmod0 probably not printed, as it is imported as module so _name_ does not equal "main".
           * When tested: if a person changes the if statement, the conditional print statement shows up in terminal
* Thought if we uncommented out code, would print inputted username (where it says request.args), html generated, etc.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
* If you don't uncomment GET and POST for both methods, but you uncomment everything else, you get a BadRequestKeyError. 
    * says it's due to line 55, which says print(request.args['username']) under disp_loginpage
        * Commenting out that line does work, wheen submitting username though it directs you to /auth, which displays "Waaaa hooo HAAAH".
    * Outcome doesn't change if one method has GET and POST uncommented while the other doesn't. (or if they both do)
* Uncommmenting print statements without DIAG in disp_loginpage doesn't seem to have an effect on what's printed in terminal
    * Nothing new displayed when just saying print(app)
    * Nothing new displayed when just saying print(request.args)
    * Nothing new displayed when just saying print(request.headers)
* Uncommenting print statements without DIAG in authenicate does have an effect on what's printed in terminal
    * Just saying print(app) prints: <Flask 'app'>
    * Just saying print(request) prints: <Request 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=name&sub1=Submit' [GET]>
    * Just saying print(request.args['username']) prints: the username submitted
    * Just saying print(request.headers) prints:
            Host: 127.0.0.1:5000
            Connection: keep-alive

        * Seems to mention OS of user, the browser being used, language, and lots of other things

* Does form action == /auth actually refer to a different page/route that the site should redirect you to if submit is pressed?
    * Can you put different responses for the same button?
* Submitting something in the username box prints the time you submitted the username and:
  "GET /auth?username=+,sd&sub1=Submit HTTP/1.1" 200 -

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


OTHER?
* Maybe the reason having the statements to print request.args['username'] result in an error is because no username has been inputted yet? So the computer doesn't know what it
refers to and it causes an error. This could also be the reason
