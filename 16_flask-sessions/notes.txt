- app.secret_key = os.urandom(32) generates a random secret key
   - is good because key isn't public
   
- It is probably best to put both "GET" and "POST" as methods to reduce risks of getting "Method Not Allowed"
   - can just use if statements to do specific things for each method type

- Username can be gotten from request.form (probably want to use POST methods instead of GET so user doesn't see input in the url)

- safe renders html tags (if using render_template and plugging html tags in)

- You are allowed to return redirect (which will take you to a different page)

- You can refer to things inputed into a request form with 'NAME OF OBJECT' (can check if present/put in before)

- Session is like a dictionary and so you can get info from it by mentioning session[key]
