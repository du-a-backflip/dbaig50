DISCOVERIES:
*Running the code by itself (without modifying code) makes an empty file
*You don't have to immediately put something in for values when inserting into the table.
    *You can use a placeholder and replace it later.
*It's important to check if table is present (otherwise will give OperationalError if table already exists)
*Using f formats strings and makes nicer tables

Q: Is there any way to open up discobandit.db itself? Or does somebody have to download SQL first?
