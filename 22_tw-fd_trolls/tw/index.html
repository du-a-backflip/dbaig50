DISCO:
Tailwind seems to have its own way of declaring colors (instead of using hexcode or rgb, you put color family and then a number showing how dark things are). It also has it's own way to show sides.
Py and Px are margins (Px is left margin, py is height/width of box)

q1 (only to be answered after you have finished... At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.)
I kind of preferred Tailwind, because I feel like it was more intuitive to me than the other 2 FEF. I liked the color system too.

                Stars are hot balls of gas, that generate energy and glow! They are neat. And they're very pretty. Usually they're made of hydrogen and helium!

                There are lots of different kinds of stars! They can be different sizes and colors and some burn hotter than others! There's dwarf stars (red, brown, yellow, black, white) and beetleguses and red giants and blue giants and protostars.
