QCC:
-when you run the urlopen the data doesnt automatically defult to a json and you have to import json and use json.load and data.read().decode() for it to turn it into a json file and then you are able to use the json file like a dictonary to find the values you need.
-I also forgot how img work so its <img src = link /> to send a image and its not (newline) its <br> to make a newline in html.
-When printing the file json starts with g'
