K35: Now Again for the First Time
2025-03-17
Time Spent: 2.5 hours

Notes: 
 - CoPilot initially built the flask app using SQLAlchemy, and classes for the blogs and Users
 - A bit of difficulty in getting it to use sqlite3 -> initially it continued to use SQLAlchemy.
 - When we got it to use sqlite3, it made an sql file to define the tables instead of doing it in the python program
 - Earlier versions of the flask app took a couple minutes to run
 - Initially CoPilot didn't give us an app where we could add blog posts despite specifying it at the beginning.
 - Error with hash -> initially used hash not supported by library of choice
 - Tells you vulnerabilities -> Very helpful

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
It took about 7 to 9 tries to get something that worked.

q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
At one point CoPilot didn't import sqlite3. We noticed this when the terminal threw an error and terminated
the program because it hadn't been imported. When we compared the newer __init__.py to an older version, we found That
CoPilot had removed the "import sqlite3" from the new version.

q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?
The bot's output is a lot cleaner than the code of our past self. It's a lot easier to read and a lot more
organized.
